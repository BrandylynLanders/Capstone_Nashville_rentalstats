# Analyzing Economic Factors on Rental Prices in Nashville: A Data-Driven Study

The objective of this data analysis capstone project is to examine the impact of economic factors on housing rental prices in Nashville. The study investigates several key areas, including the correlation between changes in Nashville's GDP and rental price fluctuations, the relationship between industry growth in various neighborhoods and increased rental prices, the correlation between short-term rental density and surrounding long-term rental prices, and the potential of using the inflation rate as a predictor for rental prices. The purpose is to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of the rental market in Nashville. The motivation behind this data analysis capstone project stems from the recognition of the critical role that economic factors play in shaping the rental market in Nashville. As an aspiring data analyst with a personal investment interest in real estate, the aim was to delve into the factors influencing rental prices and understand their impact on housing affordability in Nashville.

Nashville, being a vibrant and rapidly growing city, has witnessed significant changes in its economic landscape in recent years. The project's focus on exploring the correlation between changes in Nashville's GDP and rental price fluctuations arises from the need to comprehend how the city's economic performance directly influences housing rental costs. Understanding this relationship can provide valuable insights for policymakers, real estate investors, and residents seeking affordable housing options.

# **Data Questions**
